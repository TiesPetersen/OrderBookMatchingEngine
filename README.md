# Order Book Matching Engine
A highly optimized C++ order book matching engine. [TODO: more detailed/descriptive description]
Single threaded, deterministic

Concise performance metrics...

Image? Latency histogram? Implementation visualization from blog post?

## Features

### Place order
Places and executes a new order using price-time priority. 

**Order types**
- Limit order
- Market order

### Cancel order
Removes order from limit order book.

_Note: the modify-order operation has been left out for simplicity. Modifying an order can simply be treated as a cancel + place order. You would lose your place in the time-priority queue this way, but that is what happens in real exchanges most of time anyway._

## Performance

(Some benchmark details and performance stats to quickly showcase to recruiters)

### Benchmark Data
The benchmark uses synthetic order data created with 5 different distributions, simulating a realistic market. Prices are rounded to 2 decimal places, which causes limit orders to group at discrete price levels, resulting in realistic order book depth. The grey line represents the generated base price, which acts as a reference for limit orders placed at different distances around it. Market and cancel orders are also generated and included in the dataset.

**Note:** While this synthetic order generator doesn't capture all nuances of real-world markets, it still provides a realistic approximation for benchmarking purposes.

## Dependencies & Tooling
**Language:** C++20

**Build System:** CMake (version 4.2)

**Testing:** CTest (version 4.2)

### Development

**Formatter:** Clang-Format (Google Style, see `/.clang-format`)

**Linter:** Clang-Tidy (see `.clang-tidy`) 

## Build and Run

### Prerequisites
- **C++20 compiler** (MSVC, GCC, Clang, etc)
- **CMake**

    Download, run installer, select `Add CMake to system PATH`

### Build & Run Benchmark
Use the following commands to build and run the benchmark (`/benchmark`). Uses `Release` build type for compiler optimizations.

_Linux_
```powershell
> cmake -S . -B build_release -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
> cmake --build build_release
> ./build_release/benchmark_engine
```

### Build & Run Tests
Use the following commands to build and run the tests (`/tests`).

_Linux_
```powershell
> cmake -S . -B build_debug -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
> cmake --build build_debug
> ./build_debug/test_engine # run tests directly, or
> ctest --test-dir build_debug # run tests via ctest
```

### Build & Run During Development
Modify the `src/main.cpp` file to test individual features during development, which will be compiled into the `run_engine.exe` file.

_Linux_
```powershell
> cmake -S . -B build_debug -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
> cmake --build build_debug
> ./build_debug/run_engine
```

Use the following command to update file structure (Windows), make sure that the /build folder is deleted:
```
tree /f
```

## Contribute

### Extra / Optional Tools
- **LLVM** (for Clang-Format and Clang-Tidy)

    Download, run installer, select `Add LLVM to system PATH`
- **VS Code**

    Install VS Code and use extensions: `C/C++`, `CMake Tools` and `clangd` (make sure to disable IntelliSense for clangd to work)

### Set up Clang-Format in VS Code
Clang-Format is used for formatting the code. This guarantees that code is consistent across all files (spacing, tab size, etc)

1. Go to settings, search for "Format on Save", and turn it on.
3. Open a .cpp file and hit `Ctrl+Shift+P`
4. Search for "Format Document With", click it and press `Configure Default Formatter...` and select `clangd`.
3. Hit `Ctrl+S` to save and the code gets formatted.

### Naming Conventions
| Type | Convention | Example |
| :--- | :---: | ---: |
| Classes | PascalCase | `OrderBook`, `MatchingEngine` |
| Methods | PascalCase | `AddOrder()`, `CancelOrder()` |
| Variables | snake_case | `price_level`, `order_id` |
| Member Vars | snake_case + trailing _ | `best_bid_`, `orders_` |
| Files | snake_case | `order_book.cpp`, `tcp_server.hpp` |
| Namespaces | snake_case | `namespace exchange_core` |
| Constants | kPascalCase | `kMaxOrderSize`, `kDefaultPort` |
